Is Elkins next in line?

Now that <persName>Robert Spence</persName>, <persName>Bob Ward</persName>
and <persName>Frank Fellows</persName> have resigned under
pressure from students, the next target
is none other than the Big Man himself,
<persName>Wilson Elkins</persName>.
Though many individuals have been
harboring a desire to see the retirement
of our distinguished president, a col­
lective effort is now under way to
publicize Elkins' 15-year record of un­
responsiveness to students and the mani­
fold problems of a growing University,
He has done much for academics and
much for the University’s image, but
all too little for the raison d’etre of this
institution--the students. Remember
them?
Elkins’ availability is legendary, his
morality of another age and his public
statements a mixture of John Wayne and
Dwight Eisenhower with a little Spiro
Agnew thrown into the melange.
And with the federal vindication of the

<orgName>Student Government Association’s</orgName> year­
long declaration of institutional racism,
further impetus has been marshalled
behind those forces, anonymous for the
time being, who will soon embark on a
publicity campaign to expose Elkins’
uselessness here.
Much of Elkins’ problem is not sub­
stantive, but a matter of style wiiich is
irrelevant to the newness of modern
life.
In introducing Sen. Edmund Muskie
last week, Elkins had the unfortunate
grace to mention four times that the
senator is a loser and that we are proud
to have him speak here.
Elkins noted that the length of an
introduction is commensurate with the
speaker’s dignity and stature. <q>“But
this introduction will be brief,”</q> Elkins
faux-pased.
Perhaps Elkins, beset with all kinds
of pressure from the student body, the

legislature and from bewildered parents,
will And it quite appealing to resign and
return to teaching, or take a government
position.
Certainly his attitudes fit right in with
the Nixon non-administration.
The pressures of health, too, must be
catching up with him and that would be
as convenient an excuse as necessary to
get oat of the College Park loony bin.
Whenever it is that Elkins leaves his
beloved constituents he should remember
that old presidents don’t die—they just
lose their faculties.
♦ ♦
Speaking of presidents, the newest
darling of the law’n’order crowd. Father
Theodore Hesburgh of Notre Dame is
reputed to have dented that the publish
or perish syndrome exists at his campus.
The way he put it, the problem is
<q>“Publish or back to the parish,"</q>
Ho, ho.
